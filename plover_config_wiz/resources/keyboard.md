If you don't have a steno machine, you can use a keyboard that supports N-Key Rollover (NKRO).

## What's NKRO?

This is a feature of some keyboards that means that you can press as many keys as you want simultaniously, and they will all register. Typical keyboards stop working correctly when you press somewhere between 4 and 7 keys at once.
For more information, see the [Wikipedia entry about NKRO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rollover_(key)#n-key_rollover).

If you're unsure whether your keyboard is NKRO or not, check this page: [How do I know if my keyboard has NKRO](https://github.com/openstenoproject/plover/wiki/Supported-Hardware#how-do-i-know-if-my-keyboard-has-nkro).

## What if my keyboard is not capable of NKRO?

If you don't have a keyboard that's capable of NKRO, but still want to give Plover a try, you can arpeggiate/roll the keyboard chords. More info can be found at the bottom of [this post](http://plover.stenoknight.com/2011/02/plover-211-released.html).
