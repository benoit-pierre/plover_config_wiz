Connection
==========

If you have a **USB port:**

- Computer USB port → USB to serial adapter → serial cross-over cable → steno machine

If you have a **serial port** on your computer:

- Computer serial port → serial cross-over cable → steno machine

**It's important that there is a cross-over cable at some point of the
connection, and only one.** The Stenograph so called *"realtime cable"*
has one built in, but you can use any other RS232 (also called DB9) male
to female cross over-cable.
